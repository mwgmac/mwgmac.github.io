# reasearch

My doctoral research, funded through a Pigott Studentship, is in philosophical logic and the philosophy of logic, focused especially on inconsistency, classicality, and some relatively new logical tools (*mixed* and *metainferential* logics). My PhD is about a couple of closely related issues: 
1. Can we can deploy to combine nontrivial negation-inconsistency with a classical-strength logic? Is there an interesting rapprochment between dialetheism (the view that there are true contradictions) and classical logic (which trivialises contradiction)?
2. How are we to understand these mixed and metainferential systems? Is there a good sense in which they sit nicely within a broader (particularly dialetheic) logical theory?

I'm especially interested in the sort of questions that arise for the *classical dialetheist* who use such mixed and metainferential tools to acheive a certain kind of 'classicality'. Here are some things I'm thinking about:
- *Validity*. How should the classical dialetheist think about validity? Can they do this in both a materially adequate and perspicuous way? In particular, can they hold on to validity as truth-preservation?
- *Metainferences*. These logics bring metainferences (inferences between inferences) centre stage. How should the classical dialetheist think about metainferential validity and metainferential hierarchies?
- *Normativity*. How can a classical-strength logic adequately govern attitudes or commitments which are permitted to have inconsistent content?
- *Recapture*. Traditional dialetheists try to recapture classical forms (e.g. disjunctive syllogism). In what, if any, sense do recapture-like questions arise for the classical dialetheist? And how can they address them?
- *Paraconsistency*. How strong are the reasons for a traditional dialetheist to go classical?

I also have broader philosophical interest in philosophical logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of religion, and value theory.
