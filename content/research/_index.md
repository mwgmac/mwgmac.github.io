# reasearch

My PhD, based in the [Cambridge Philosophy Faculty](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/), is funded through a Pigott Studentship and supervised by [Prof Michael Potter](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/potter) and [Dr Michael Gabbay](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Gabbay-2).

The project, sitting mostly in philosophical logic and the philosophy of logic, focuses on the relationship between dialetheism (the view that there are true contradictions) and how (interpreted) logical systems handle contradictions. 

One issue I am interested in is the extent to which there can be an interesting rapprochment between dialetheism and classical consequence (which is normally thought to trivialise contradictions). The possibility of this is suggested by what I call 'extensionally classical inconsistency-tolerant' (XCIT) logics, which, while they agree with classical logic about validity, do not trivialise contradiction. Some specific issues that arise in the context of this 'classical dialetheism' are:
- *Normativity*. How can a classical-strength logic adequately govern attitudes or commitments which are permitted to have inconsistent content?
- *Recapture*. Traditional dialetheists try to recapture classical forms (e.g. disjunctive syllogism). In what, if any, sense do recapture-like questions arise for the classical dialetheist? And how can they address them?
- *Paraconsistency*. Typically, dialetheists endorse a *paraconsistent* logic which drops the principle of explosion (a contradiction entails everything) and related principles. But if other options are available, should they?
- *Metainferences*. XCIT logics bring metainferences (inferences between inferences) centre stage. How should we think about metainferential validity and metainferential hierarchies if we endorse an XCIT logic?


Another issue I'm thinking about is the relation between dialetheism and logic itself. In particular, as well as endorsing an inconsistency-tolerant *logic*, some dialetheists also endorse an inconsistency-tolerant *metatheory* (i.e. they characterise their preferred logic within an inconsistency-tolerant theory). Some questions here:
- How strong are the reasons for a dialetheist to endorse an inconsistency-tolerant metatheory?
- What does this tell us about satisfaction and validity? Can these notions coherently be given their intended meaning in such a context?
- Could logic itself be inconsistent?


I also have broader philosophical interest in philosophical logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of religion, and value theory.
