# about

I'm a PhD student in Philosophy at [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge. Before that, I did an MA (Hons) in Philosophy at Edinburgh, then an MPhil in Philosophy at Cambridge (also at Peterhouse). My MPhil projects were on versions of the modal ontological argument for the existence of God using iterated operators, the effects of intensionalism on metanormative theory (particularly the non/naturalism distinction and metanormative minimalism), and the compatibility of dialetheism with classical-strength logics (closely related to my PhD work).

At Cambridge, I've been involved in running the graduate logic conference for a couple of years, and I'm an incoming convener of the [Serious Metaphysics Group](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/seminars-phil/SMG). At Edinburgh, I was heavily involved in the wonderful [Edinburgh University Philosophy Society](https://www.euphilsoc.com/).

I grew up in Carlisle on the Anglo-Scottish border, known for biscuits, reivers, and the Royal Navy advert. (It should be better known for its fascinating [cathedral](https://carlislecathedral.org.uk/history/) and [nationalised pubs](https://thestatemanagementstory.org/).) My father is from Ayrshire and my mother from North Yorkshire.

Besides philosophy, I like music, pub culture (and ale), and (when in the right mood) poetry.
