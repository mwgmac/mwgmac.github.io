# about

I'm a PhD student in Philosophy at [Peterhouse](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge. Before that, I did an MA (Hons) in Philosophy at Edinburgh, then an MPhil in Philosophy at Cambridge (also at Peterhouse). My MPhil projects were on 'iterated' versions of the modal ontological argument for the existence of God, the effects of intensionalism on metanormative theory, and the compatibility of dialetheism with classical-strength logics (closely related to my PhD work).

At Cambridge, I've been involved in running the graduate logic conference for a couple of years ([this year](https://sites.google.com/view/cambridge-logic-19)), and I'm coconvener of the [Serious Metaphysics Group](https://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/seminars-phil/SMG). I also teach a bit. At Edinburgh, I was heavily involved in the wonderful [Edinburgh University Philosophy Society](https://www.euphilsoc.com/).

I grew up in Carlisle near the Anglo-Scottish border, known for biscuits, reivers, and the Royal Navy advert. (It should be better known for its fascinating [cathedral](https://carlislecathedral.org.uk/history/) and [nationalised pubs](https://thestatemanagementstory.org/).) I am half English and half Scottish.

Besides philosophy, I like music, pub culture (and ale), and (when in the right mood) poetry.
