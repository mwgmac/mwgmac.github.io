# papers and talks

## papers in progress

- *On satisfaction, truth-preservation, and dialetheism*. I argue that, rather surprisingly, dialetheism motivates an explosion-friendly understanding of satisfaction---indepedently of the stronger resulting consequence relation.
- *On the (logical) global notion of metainferential validity*. I argue that the global notion of validity can't do as a notion of *logical* validity because, on pain of trivialising informative theories, it cannot embody the universality of logic. One can just about fix this, but the fix raises its own issues.
- *On the normativity of consequence, assertion, and dialetheism*. I outline and try to solve a puzzle for the classical dialetheist: How can an explosive logic govern assertion and assertoric commitment when these are permitted to have inconsistent contents? I suggest that the trick is to relativise norms of assertoric commitment to distinct modes thereof. Adding an initially unexpected, but at the end of the day well-motivated, principle linking these modes of commitment to consequence addresses the puzzle.
