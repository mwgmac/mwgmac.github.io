# papers and talks

## papers in progress

- *On satisfaction, truth-preservation, and dialetheism*. I explore to what extent 'XCIT-apt' satisfaction standards (which give rise to classical consequence without trivialising inconsistency) are motivated by dialetheism, independent of the stronger consequence relation.
- *On the (logical) global notion of metainferential validity*. I argue that the global notion of validity can't do as a notion of *logical* validity because, on pain of trivialising informative theories, it cannot embody the topic-neutrality and universality of logic. One can fix this, but I suggest the fix is really just simulating local validity.
- *On the normativity of consequence, assertion, and dialetheism*. I outline and try to solve a puzzle for the classical dialetheist: How can an explosive logic govern attitudes or commitments which are permitted to have inconsistent content? Focusing on assertion as an illuminating case study, I suggest that the trick is to relativise norms of assertoric commitment to distinct modes thereof. Adding a somewhat unexpected, but at the end of the day natural (I contend), principle linking these modes of commitment to consequence addresses the puzzle.
